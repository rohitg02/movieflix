# Module-api
My project is in movieflix folder

### Achieved During The Project
Successfully created sort, filter, add movie, update movie, delete movie, create user, create user , delete user, and all the get commands related to that

### Future scope for improvement and functionality need to be done
* Comment, rating, adding movies in playlist  
* Seperate service layer for login
* Managing the components in more proper way
* Using security features so that data can't be accessed without login ex: users/{id}
* Assigning value instead of hardcoding them: Instead of users using {role} and assigning value users to role so it's flexible to change
